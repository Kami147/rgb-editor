The RGB Changer tool is a Work in progress tool to  automatically modify images, 
I made this tool to make new Minecraft texture packs, but it can be used for much more.

# How to use

- Insert your Red, Green and blue values, they should be between 1 & 255.
- Insert your desired directory. (don't put your main directory, this will likely crash.)
- Press the "CONFIRM" button. You'll see your desired colour highlighted around the GUI.
- Go to your desired file and check the file has been modified.
